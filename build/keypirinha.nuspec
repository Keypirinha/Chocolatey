    <releaseNotes>## v2.17 - 2017-11-03

### Application

* If the *Paste* hotkey (`hotkey_paste` setting) is pressed twice in a row, the selected item will be executed without having to press `Enter`
* Added a *Diagnostic Window*, accessible by pressing `F3` from the
  LaunchBox, via the main menu, or by executing the
  `Keypirinha: Diagnostic Window` item
* Desktop and Start Menu items are not automatically refreshed anymore if Keypirinha is installed in the Desktop or Start Menu folder ([#229](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/229))
* Invoking the LaunchBox does not bring back the Console to front anymore

### FileBrowser package

* Fixed: the plugin will not try to make suggestions from input `::`

### FilesCatalog package

* **IMPORTANT:** the default filtering behavior has changed in order to be more intuitive ([#253](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/253), [#254](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/254))
* **IMPORTANT:** the `regex` property of the `filters` setting now matches
  the **full path** by default
* The `filters` setting accepts new properties: `case` and `nodrive`

### URL package

* Minor improvements

### WebSearch package

* Added the `multi_url_delay` setting to help ensuring multiple URLs are opened in order

### API

* `keypirinha.Events.DESKTOP` and `keypirinha.Events.STARTMENU` events are not sent anymore in case Keypirinha is installed in one of the Desktop or Start Menu folders (documentation updated)
* The generic `globex.py` and `filefilter.py` modules embedded in the
  `FilesCatalog` package are now distributed with Keypirinha and are usable
  by any plugin
