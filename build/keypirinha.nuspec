Keypirinha is a fast launcher for keyboard ninjas on Windows.

### Features

* Launch a search on any configured website or online dictionary
* Language translations on-the-fly
* Evaluate mathematical expressions
* Base conversion of numbers
* Search your environment variables
* Launch a copied URL directly (`http`, `mailto`, `skype`, ...)
* Split a URL and convert its arguments to JSON
* Switch to a running application by name
* Hash a string (CRC32, MD5, SHA, ...)
* Generate random UUIDs, passwords, bytes sequences
* Naturally associate a keyword to a specific item
* Machine-specific and/or user-specific configuration in separate config files

### Properties

* Plugin-oriented architecture (C++ at its core, [Python3](https://python.org) for its plugins)
* File-driven configuration
* Lightning fast
* Fairly small memory footprint
* Battery friendly
* Customizable GUI (colors, fonts, toggling and positioning of elements)
* Steep but rewarding learning curve
* Freeware, no nag screen, no time limit, no ads

You can think of Keypirinha as an alternative to *Launchy* and a cousin of *Alfred*.

    <releaseNotes>## v2.19 - 2018-09-13

### Application

* Added the `config_editor` setting so that Keypirinha's configuration files can be edited with a specific text editor ([#264](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/264))
* Added: `satellite_size` setting now accepts the `superjumbo` value to
  render 256x256 icon ([#298](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/298))
* Added support for environment variables notation like `%USERNAME%` in the `portable.ini` file ([#315](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/315))
* Added the `loop_list` setting ([#301](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/301))
* Fixed: the satellite icon was not always positioned and scaled properly in HiDPI ([#210](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/210))
* Fixed: the `space_as_tab` setting is now ignored unless the caret is at the
  end of the search terms while the `Space` key is pressed
* Fixed: `Ctrl+BackSpace` did not erase anything when the text box selection was not empty ([#302](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/302))
* Fixed: `color_title` value was overwritten by `color_foreground`
  internally ([#316](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/316))
* Fixed: `color_status` value was overwritten by `color_faded` internally ([#316](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/316))
* Fixed: Keypirinha should now be able to run from a shared folder or a mounted
  network drive (Python failed to initialize from a UNC path; [#267](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/267))
* Minor improvements

### FilesCatalog package

* Fixed: the `PathShellFilter has no attribute name` error that was occuring in some configuration cases ([#275](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/275))
* Fixed: the `string index out of range` error that could occur when a
  `paths` value contains a recursive search inside a drive letter only
  ([#314](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/314))

### String package

* Added `String: Base64` item (base64 encoder/decoder; thanks to [@alexandr-san4ez](https://github.com/alexandr-san4ez))

### API

* `keypirinha_wintypes.get_known_folder_path` accepts known folder's name
