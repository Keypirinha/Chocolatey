    <releaseNotes>## v2.16 - 2017-10-20

**NEW PACKAGE:** [packages/filescatalog](http://keypirinha.com/packages/filescatalog.html)

### Application

* Added support of a `portable.ini` file to manually specify the location of the `portable` directory (see [install](http://keypirinha.com/install.html) for more info; [#233](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/233))
* Added support of the `--show` and `--hide` command line arguments
  ([#237](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/237))
* Added predefined configuration variables `APP_DRIVE` and `APP_ARCH` (see [configuration](http://keypirinha.com/configuration.html); [#240](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/240))
* Minor optimizations
* Fixed: the `Browse Profile Dir` menu/item now uses the `file_explorer` setting
* Fixed: the `Ctrl+Del` shortcut did not work in History Mode
* Fixed: the results list was not refreshed when an item was removed from the history in History Mode
* Fixed: configuration files were not loaded when the character `$` was used
  in any value of the `[var]` section ([#235](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/235))
* Fixed: Keypirinha failed to parse system's proxy settings if no proxy scheme was specified. Proxy scheme now defaults to HTTP and a warning message is emitted to the console ([#243](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/243))

### Apps package

* The `extra_paths` setting has been obsoleted by the new [packages/filescatalog](http://keypirinha.com/packages/filescatalog.html). It is still supported but is not documented anymore in the default configuration file and will not receive any further improvement.
* More informational messages

### FileBrowser package

* Fixed support for UNCs ([#212](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/212))

### GoogleTranslate package

* Fixed: only the translation of the first sentence was shown when multiple sentences were to translate. Thanks to [@alexandr-san4ez](https://github.com/alexandr-san4ez) ([#234](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/234), [PR #5](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Packages/pull/5))

### API

* Fixed: `keypirinha_util.execute_default_action` now opens directories using the `file_explorer` setting ([#241](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha/issues/241))
* Embedded Python interpreter upgraded from 3.6.0 to 3.6.3
* Updated documentation chapter: [api/python](http://keypirinha.com/api/python.html)
